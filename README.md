# **ABOUT ME**

Hi! I’m Magda, a Czech-based visual storyteller: I love drawing a silly doodle in the corner of my notebook - a story to tell and making the most boring and ordinary object pretty, and aesthetic and giving said object a spark.

My spark for arts started forming when a family put me in arts & crafts and then a painting class at the age of 12. 

One summer afternoon in 2018 I realised that my art was too monotone, and I started to actively improve my skills. That moment gradually led to who I am now, a person who makes illustrations, 3d modelling and animation.

Art in any form has always been my hobby - I enjoy reading and writing and watching short movies but also acting in them. 

Besides sitting in my room all day, I do sports like skiing, swimming and rollerblading, or I just take a walk with my sister and our dog.

A Cambridge certificate that shows that my level of English is B2 – upper-intermediate.

## Graduation (2021)

I graduated from English-Czech High School Amazon focused on English. Besides intensive studies of the practical language (6 lessons a week), some subjects were taught in English by native speakers - I also “consumed” a lot of English - reading (both as part of the curriculum and as a hobby) and watching films in the original version. 
The subjects that I graduated from were translation & interpretation and IT.


## MY VISION ZERO: STUDENTS FOR SAFE ROADS
![winners holding a prise ](images-01/MV0_foto_vyherci_5.jpg)

From 1993 to 2022, 28 524 people died on the roads in the Czech Republic. Hundreds more will be added each year,

Vision Zero is zero deaths and serious injuries on the roads.


MY VISION ZERO: STUDENTS FOR SAFE ROADS" was intended for students of Czech universities and secondary schools. The competition aimed to encourage young people to improve the state of road accidents in the Czech Republic

Students or groups of students submitted projects focusing on different areas to solve traffic problems. The projects could address vehicle and road problems as well as road user behaviour and education.

  I registered for the competition as a member of a team of 6 people in the school year 2022/2023.  We did a project called “Learning about safety via a game”. 

Our project focused on traffic education. We designed a concept for a board game for children from kindergarten to 3rd grade of primary school. The aim was to introduce children to the basics of safety, which they can build on in the following years and then expand their knowledge.

In the competition, 118 other projects were registered and we won the 5th place. 

For this game, I illustrated pexeso cards for learning the basics of first aid and telephone numbers of police, ambulance and the police in the Czech Republic I also created magnets and illustrations of dangerous and safe situations
