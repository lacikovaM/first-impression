# **ABOUT ME**

Hi! I’m Magda, a Czech-based visual storyteller: I love drawing a silly doodle in the corner of my notebook - a story to tell and making the most boring and ordinary object pretty, and aesthetic and giving said object a spark.

My spark for arts started forming when a family put me in arts & crafts and then a painting class at the age of 12. 

One summer afternoon in 2018 I realised that my art was too monotone, and I started to actively improve my skills. That moment gradually led to who I am now, a person who makes illustrations, 3d modelling and animation.

Art in any form has always been my hobby - I enjoy reading and writing and watching short movies but also acting in them. 

Besides sitting in my room all day, I do sports like skiing, swimming and rollerblading, or I just take a walk with my sister and our dog.

I graduated from English-Czech High School Amazon focused on English. Besides intensive studies of the practical language (6 lessons a week), some subjects were taught in English by native speakers - I also “consumed” lot of English - reading (both as part of the curriculum and as a hobby) and watching films in original version. 
The subjects that I graduated from were translation & interpretation and IT.
